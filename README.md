# GlyphStream™ Sync Core
**Kairos Sigil Merge API (LAH-MAH-TOR) — seal-based convergence for a zero-DB global registry**

Author: **BJ Klock** — *Kai Rex Klok (K℞K)*  
Live: **https://align.kaiklok.com**

GlyphStream™ is the sync primitive that makes “global state with no database” real:

- **Clients** build a lineage graph locally from share URLs (witness chains + Kai payload).
- **This API** provides **optional convergence** across devices via:
  - a deterministic **state seal** (like an ETag for truth),
  - a paged **URL registry** (the shared “known set”),
  - and a batched **inhale** endpoint for uploading new krystals.

No feeds table. No thread table. No graph table.  
Just **URLs + seals + deterministic merge.**

---

## What this repo is

A production FastAPI service that:
1. **Inhales** krystal batches (`POST /sigils/inhale`)
2. Extracts / dedupes / merges URLs + Kai payload
3. Maintains a **registry state** (URLs + latest Kai moments)
4. Exposes:
   - `GET /sigils/seal` → current state seal
   - `GET /sigils/urls` → paged URL list + state seal

This is the backend counterpart to the client-side GlyphStream™ explorer.

## API

### 1) Get current state seal
**GET** `/sigils/seal`

Returns a deterministic fingerprint of server state:
```json
{ "seal": "2f0ff4ef2d08249cece9ee58cdc4050b" }
````

### 2) List known URLs (paged)

**GET** `/sigils/urls?offset=0&limit=200`

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "state_seal": "2f0ff4ef2d08249cece9ee58cdc4050b",
  "total": 1,
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 200,
  "urls": [
    "https://align.kaiklok.com/s/<hash>?p=..."
  ]
}
```

### 3) Inhale krystals (batched upload)

**POST** `/sigils/inhale`

* `multipart/form-data`
* `file=@batch.json;type=application/json`
* batch file is a JSON array of krystal records

Example krystal record:

```json
{
  "url": "https://align.kaiklok.com/s/<hash>?p=...",
  "pulse": 9615429,
  "beat": 26,
  "stepIndex": 8,
  "kaiSignature": "…",
  "chakraDay": "Heart"
}
```

The server should ingest idempotently (dedupe by URL) and update state seal only when state changes.

---

## Why “seal → urls” works

GlyphStream™ clients don’t need “real-time DB sync.” They need one question answered:

> “Has the shared registry changed since the last breath?”

So the client does:

1. `GET /sigils/seal`
2. If changed → `GET /sigils/urls` and import what’s new

This keeps the sync surface tiny, observable, cacheable, and debuggable.

---

## Kai-time (KKS-1.0)

This service is Kai-native:

* ordering and “latest” calculations use **pulse → beat → stepIndex**
* no Chronos timestamps are required for truth ordering
* Chronos may exist at the infrastructure layer, but not as a correctness primitive

See:

* `app/core/kai_time.py`

---

## Local development

### 1) Install

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2) Run

```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 3) Smoke test

```bash
bash test_curl.sh
```

Or direct:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/sigils/seal" | jq
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/sigils/urls?offset=0&limit=10" | jq
```

---

## Production verification (align.kaiklok.com)

### Inspect URL registry

```bash
curl -s "https://align.kaiklok.com/sigils/urls?offset=0&limit=200" \
  | jq '. | {total, offset, limit, state_seal, sample: (.urls[0:10])}'
```

### Inspect seal

```bash
curl -s "https://align.kaiklok.com/sigils/seal" | jq
```

## Client integration (GlyphStream™ Explorer)

The client-side Explorer:

* stores URLs locally (registry)
* reconstructs lineage from witness chains (`add=`) + derived context
* posts new local URLs to this API (`/sigils/inhale`)
* polls each φ-pulse for seal changes (`/sigils/seal`)
* pulls new URLs if the seal changed (`/sigils/urls`)

This API intentionally does not need to know about UI trees or thread rendering.
It only maintains the shared “known set” and a deterministic seal.

---

## Security model

This service is designed to be simple and composable:

* Put it behind auth / WAF / rate limits if you need access control.
* Treat `inhale` as untrusted input: enforce size limits and validate JSON.
* The server should never assume payload fields are “true” beyond parsing/shape.
